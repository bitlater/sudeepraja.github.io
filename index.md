## Hi there!
My name is Artem, currently I am CIFRE PhD student at **[Criteo AI lab](http://ailab.criteo.com)** and **[AMA LIG research team](http://ama.liglab.fr)**. I got a masterâ€™s degrees of Industrial and Applied Mathematics from the **[Universite Grenoble Alpes](https://msiam.imag.fr/)** and of Applied Physics and Mathematics from the **[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology](http://www.mipt.ru/)**.

<!--- I just graduted from the **[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology](http://www.mipt.ru/)** with a **Bachelor's degree in [System Programming](http://www.ispras.ru/en/groups/modis/)**. I work as a **marketer and data analyst at [Rocketbank](https://www.rocketbank.ru/)** and do **research at [Institute for System Programming of the Russian Academy of Sciences](http://ispras.ru/en/)**. ---> 

<!--- I aspire to become a researcher working in Data Science. ---> 
My areas of interest are machine and deep learning, data analysis. During the PhD I do research in uplift prediction and counterfactual learning for digital advertising. Previously I also worked on applications of machine and deep learning approaches for problems on natural language processing (text classification) and computer vision (style transfer, image segmentation).
<!--- I have briefly worked on the problem of Customer Churn prediction in Mobile Banking. ---> 

Here I blog about curious things I encounter while reading books or while on the internet. These are things mostly related to the topics mentioned above.
