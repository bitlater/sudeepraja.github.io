# Hi There!
My name is Artem betley. I just graduted from the **[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology](http://www.mipt.ru/)** with a **Bachelor's degree in [System Programming](http://www.ispras.ru/en/groups/modis/)**. I work as a **marketer and data analyst at [Rocketbank](https://www.rocketbank.ru/)** and do **research at [Institute for System Programming of the Russian Academy of Sciences](http://ispras.ru/en/)**. I will be joining **an internship at [Philips Lightning](https://www.lighting.philips.com) as a researcher**.

I aspire to become a researcher working in Data Science. My areas of interest are Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Image Recognition. My work so far was mostly on application of Machine and Deep Learning Approaches for problems on NLP, specifically for Marital Status Prediction in Social Networks. I have briefly worked on the problem of Customer Churn prediction in Mobile Banking. 

I blog about curious things I encounter while reading books or while on the internet. These are things mostly related to the topics mentioned above.
